Knockout is a JavaScript library that helps you to create rich, responsive display and editor user interfaces with a clean underlying data model. Any time you have sections of UI that update dynamically (e.g., changing depending on the userâ€™s actions or when an external data source changes), KO can help you implement it more simply and maintainably.
